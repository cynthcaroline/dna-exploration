ACGT in a DNA molecule: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). 
A DNA molecule consists of two strands wound around each other, with each strand held together by bonds between the bases. 
Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. The sequence of bases in a portion of a DNA molecule, called a gene, carries the instructions needed to assemble a protein.
